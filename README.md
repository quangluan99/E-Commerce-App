This Project is a feature-rich e‑commerce app built entirely in clean architecture, offering secure role‑based authentication for both Admins and Users. The intuitive Admin Panel enables product management—add, delete, filter—and real‑time order viewing, while customers can browse, add to cart or favorites, and complete purchases seamlessly. Integrated secure payment lets users add funds and pay safely, with Firebase ensuring carts, orders, and favorites persist across sessions. Real‑time updates keep stock levels, order statuses, and payments accurate instantly, and shoppers can select product colors and sizes . Advanced state management with Riverpod and performance optimizations guarantee a smooth, responsive UI on every device.
